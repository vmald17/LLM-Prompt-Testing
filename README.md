# LLM-Prompt-Testing

## Overview
This repository contains example tests and evaluations of AI-generated responses from large language models (LLMs) for educational purposes. The goal is to demonstrate analyzing LLM outputs, labeling responses, and refining prompts for clarity, accuracy, and usefulness in learning environments.

## Example Tasks
- **Prompt Evaluation:** Tested various prompts to assess how the LLM generates educational content for different grade levels.
- **Response Labeling:** Reviewed and labeled LLM-generated answers for correctness, relevance, and tone.
- **Pattern Analysis:** Identified recurring errors or inconsistencies in AI responses to improve future prompts.  
  *Example: Noticed the AI often gave overly complex definitions for 2nd-grade science terms, so prompts were adjusted for simpler language.*
- **Ground Truth Examples:** Created example responses to validate the evaluation process.  
  *Example Prompt:* "Explain photosynthesis to a 2nd-grade student in simple terms."  
  *AI Response:* "Photosynthesis is how plants eat sunlight and make food to grow."  
  *Evaluation:* ✅ Correct, simple, age-appropriate. Response clearly explains the concept without unnecessary complexity.

## Skills Highlighted
- Prompt writing and iteration
- AI content evaluation and labeling
- Data organization and pattern recognition
- Basic analytical skills for educational AI testing

## Notes
This repository serves as a demonstration of skills relevant to AI quality analysis in education technology. All tests are hypothetical and created for portfolio purposes.
